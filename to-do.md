# React Maze

## Doing / Done
- [x] Simple static page
- [x] Algorithm to generate random perfect mazes
- [x] Button to call algorithm and display colored maze
- [x] Set player and end positions
- [x] Enable player movement
- [x] Show win modal
- [x] Put maze in a frame and resize it
- [x] Timer since start
- [x] Display final timer in the modal
- [x] Create a "Restart same maze" button
- [x] Button to surrender and show solution
- [x] Algorithm to find the solution
- [x] Refact code, separating in files and components
- [x] Fix the Cumulative Layout Shift caused by the validation msg
- [x] Add random start and end positions
- [ ] Add animations
  - [x] Show start of the maze (maybe display "21x21 Maze")
  - [x] Word "Restarted" when clicked the restart button
  - [ ] Win animations
- [x] Custom shapes of the player and the end


## To do
- Improve the visual of the page
- Dark/light mode
- Use the maze code in the lib folder as an API

## Backlog
- Loading circle (is necessary?)
- Localization (add other languages)
- Optimize performance in large maze (?)
- Add responsiveness
- Show buttons to move when on mobile (?)
  

## Doesn't make sense
- Save player time and maze size
- Ranking of times per size
