# React Maze

## Doing / Done
- [x] Simple static page
- [x] Algorithm to generate random perfect mazes
- [x] Button to call algorithm and display colored maze
- [x] Set player and end positions
- [x] Enable player movement
- [x] Show win modal
- [x] Put maze in a frame and resize it
- [x] Timer since start
- [x] Display final timer in the modal
- [x] Create a "Restart same maze" button
- [ ] Button to surrender and show solution
- [ ] Algorithm to find the solution


## To do
- Refact code, separating in files and components
- Improve the visual of the page
- Add animations
  - Show start of the maze (maybe display "21x21 Maze")
  - Word "Restarted" when clicked the restart button
  - Win animations


## Backlog
- Optimize performance in large maze (?)
- Add responsiveness
- Show buttons to move when on mobile (?)
- Save player time and maze size
- Ranking of times per size (makes sense?)
